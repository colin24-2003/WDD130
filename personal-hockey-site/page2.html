                    <p>Hockey is played on an ice rink with six players per team: one goaltender and five skaters. The objective is simple - score more goals than your opponent by shooting a rubber puck into their net. Games consist of three 20-minute periods with intermissions between each.</p>
                    <p>Understanding a few key rules will dramatically improve your viewing experience. "Offside" occurs when attacking players enter the offensive zone before the puck. "Icing" happens when a player shoots the puck from behind the center red line past the opponent's goal line without it being touched. Both result in faceoffs in specific locations.</p>

                    <p>When players break rules, they serve time in the "penalty box," giving the opposing team a "power play" - a player advantage for a specified time (usually 2 minutes). Common penalties include tripping, hooking, slashing, and high-sticking. The team playing shorthanded is on the "penalty kill."</p>
                    <p>Players use sticks to control the puck and wear substantial protective equipment. Each position has specific responsibilities: Forwards (centers and wings) focus primarily on offense; defensemen protect their zone and support attacks; goaltenders prevent goals using specialized equipment.</p>
